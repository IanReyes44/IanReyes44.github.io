# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Ian Reyes and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 involved using random number generation to make a static
    noise image, similar to what you would see on old CRT TVs and display a
    clear message over the top of the static. This is all while the static is
    continuously changing. This lab was a favorite because it taught me how to
    create an image from scratch an to animate it. I created functions that
    went pixel by pixel, determining what color they should be through random
    number generation. once the whole image was done it pushed it back into a
    vecote and started working on the next static image.
    
* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because it gave me a general idea of how 
    spell checking programs can work. I was able to write functions that went
    through a dictionary file and stored each word in a vector and compared
    them with the words in a vector extracted from a test file. I'm sure there
    are more efficient ways to verify spelling, regardless i learned a lot from
    this particular lab.
    
 * Lab 11
 
    Lab 11, part 1 was an especially interesting lab since it requires you to
    read a file and extract specific information and ignoring irrelevant data.
    the lab also included classes and class functions with public and private
    members which made it easier for organising how the code flowed. I was able
    to create class functions that allowed me to loop through a file containing
    lots of information on each state ranging from population percent change to
    land area and save the relevant data to use in future calculations. I found
    this lab to teach me a lot about navigating through files with the use of
    code.
